Python - import & modules
In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.
You can use modules to organize your code into reusable, standalone components.

To use a module in your code, you can import it using the import statement. For example, if you have a module called my_module.py, you can import it in another Python file like this: import my_module

Once you've imported a module, you can use any functions, 
classes, or variables defined in it by prefixing them with the module name. 
For example, if my_module contains a function 
called my_function, you can call it like this:
result = my_module.my_function(argument)

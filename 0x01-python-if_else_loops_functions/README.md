Python - if/else, loops, functions


In Python, if/else, loops, and functions are programming constructs that allow for creating complex and dynamic programs.
if/else: This construct allows for conditional execution of code. It takes a condition as
input and executes a block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the
condition is false.

loops: Loops allow for repeated execution of a block of code.
There are two types of loops in Python: for loops and while loops.

# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

functions: Functions are blocks of code that can be executed when called.
They are used to break down a program into smaller, more manageable parts,
making it easier to debug and maintain.

0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

In Python, classes and objects are fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming
(OOP). A class is like a blueprint or template that defines the attributes (variables) and
behaviors (methods) that an object of that class can have.An object, on the other hand,
is an instance of a class, meaning it is created based 
on the class definition and represents a specific entity.

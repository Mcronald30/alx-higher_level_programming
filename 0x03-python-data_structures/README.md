0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

The most basic data structure in Python is the sequence.
Each element of a sequence is assigned a number - its position or index.

Python has six built-in types of sequences, but the most common ones are
lists and tuples

The list is a most versatile datatype available in Python
which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items)
between square brackets.
Creating a list is as simple as putting different
 comma-separated values between square brackets. For example âˆ’
list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];

A tuple is a collection of objects which ordered and immutable.
Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are,
the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, 
whereas lists use square brackets.

0x05-python-exceptions

In Python, exceptions are a way to handle and respond to
errors that occur during the execution of a program.
When an error occurs, an exception object is raised, and if not
handled properly, it can cause the program to terminate.
The commonly used exception classes include Exception,
TypeError, ValueError, IOError, and FileNotFoundError, among others.
